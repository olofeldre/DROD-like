# Project Description

## What is the project about?
    
Our project is a top down roguelike and turn-based, similar to another game called [DROD](http://caravelgames.com/Articles/Games_2/TSS.html). The game will be 2D.

### Game rules

The game map is a grid and you can move in eight directions. You have a sword you can also point in eight directions. There will be enemies on the map that move towards you every time you make a move. If the sword touches an enemy, the enemy takes damage. If the enemy touches you, you die. The goal of the game is to kill all the enemies on the map and continue to the next map.
